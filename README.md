# UnityHelios

This repository is designed as an application for Helios, the software created by Brian Bailey and the Plant Simulation Lab at UC Davis. It is used in conjunction
with Helios, which is a c++ program. XML and OBJ files are created in Helios, and then imported into the UnityHelios program.
